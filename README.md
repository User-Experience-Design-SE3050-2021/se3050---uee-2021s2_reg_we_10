Mobile App | Machan Eats,
Developer | Ribelz Digital

Purpose :
*Machan Eats is a local Food Delivery Application. People can order food from Machan Restaurant chains and have it delivered right to their doorstep via this app. 
It also has a contactless table ordering feature which allows the user to reserve tables beforehand. So, what we are going to do here is redesign the App in a novel 
way to increase its usability, accuracy, and efficiency. The main goal is to make the user’s interaction with the App, as efficient and smooth as possible.
*When we redesign the app we intend to fulfill the user’s needs with improved efficiency, hence provide an enhanced User Experience.
